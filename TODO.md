 -  Alternative way to publish content as Github Page.

    Currently, as we use the `master` branch `./docs` folder method, the current
    branch is loaded with heavy stuff such as the resulting content, reveal.js
    dependencies, etc.

    Using the alternate branch method (`gh-pages` branch) would be better as it
    wouldn't clutter the `master` branch with heavy files.

    site](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

    IDEA: Mount a sub-repository at `./docs` pointing / tracking this
    repository's `gh-pages` branch.
